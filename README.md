A very simple iOS app that tracks your current location and analyzes the results. 

# To Build / Use
I intend to publish this on the app store at some point, but if you want to check it out now try the following:

1. Pull down and build with Xcode.
2. Debug with your phone connected as a debug device.
3. After you initially run in debug mode, the app will stay on phone.

I have only tried this on an iPhone 5s. Anyother device, who knows?
